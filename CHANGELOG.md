# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed: a release that failed signature verification or the pin check was
  re-downloaded (up to 500 MB) on every poll. It is now checked once and
  skipped until a newer release appears; the error stays visible.
- Fixed: APK verification (`apksigner`/`aapt`) no longer blocks the web UI
  while it runs.
- Fixed: a release tag containing `/` crashed its repo's check, and any
  unexpected error in one repo stopped every repo after it from being polled.
- Fixed: removing a repo now deletes its staged APK files from disk.
- Fixed: error messages sent to the Staged page (e.g. "Device is not
  trusted") were never displayed.
- New: staged APK retention — only the newest `KEEP_RELEASES_PER_REPO`
  (default 3) files per repo are kept; install history is preserved. Staged
  files can also be deleted by hand.
- New: automated test suite (`pytest`).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-16

- Push is now a background job: submitting a push redirects immediately to a
  status page (`/installs/<id>`) that auto-refreshes (no JavaScript — CSP
  stays `script-src 'none'`) and shows an animated progress bar through
  pending → installing → success/failed. A crash mid-install now always
  resolves the install row instead of leaving it stuck "installing" forever.
- Staged APKs now capture and display each release's GitHub release notes
  (new `release_notes` column, auto-migrated for existing databases).
- Repos page gets a visual pass: status badges, tag pills, and a
  watched/error-count summary line.
- The running app version now shows in the page header, read from `VERSION`
  at container build time.
- Theme switcher: Flashbang (light), Dark, and OLED black, chosen via a
  CSRF-protected form and stored as a plain cookie — no client-side JS. With
  no preference set, the app still follows the OS `prefers-color-scheme` as
  before.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-16

Initial scaffold: two-container system (`adb-server` for the ADB protocol,
`app` for the FastAPI web UI + poller) that watches GitHub repos for new APK
releases and pushes verified builds to trusted, wireless-paired Android
devices.

- GitHub release polling with signer-certificate and package-name pinning on
  the first release seen per repo; every later release must match both or is
  rejected and surfaced, never silently skipped.
- Device pairing/connect/trust flow over wireless ADB, with device identity
  re-confirmed immediately before every push (address drift protection).
- Session-cookie auth (signed, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`) with CSRF
  tokens on every state-changing request, login rate limiting, and
  `TrustedHostMiddleware` + CSP/security headers.
- `adb`, `apksigner`, and `aapt` built into the images from Google's official
  releases with pinned URLs and verified SHA-1 checksums, not a third-party
  pre-built image.
- `adb-server`'s port is confined to the internal Docker network — never
  published to the host or LAN.
