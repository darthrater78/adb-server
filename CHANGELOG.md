# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-16

Initial scaffold: two-container system (`adb-server` for the ADB protocol,
`app` for the FastAPI web UI + poller) that watches GitHub repos for new APK
releases and pushes verified builds to trusted, wireless-paired Android
devices.

- GitHub release polling with signer-certificate and package-name pinning on
  the first release seen per repo; every later release must match both or is
  rejected and surfaced, never silently skipped.
- Device pairing/connect/trust flow over wireless ADB, with device identity
  re-confirmed immediately before every push (address drift protection).
- Session-cookie auth (signed, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`) with CSRF
  tokens on every state-changing request, login rate limiting, and
  `TrustedHostMiddleware` + CSP/security headers.
- `adb`, `apksigner`, and `aapt` built into the images from Google's official
  releases with pinned URLs and verified SHA-1 checksums, not a third-party
  pre-built image.
- `adb-server`'s port is confined to the internal Docker network — never
  published to the host or LAN.
